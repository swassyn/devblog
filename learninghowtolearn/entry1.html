    Introduction:
    Per the suggestion of The Odin Project, I decided to give the free coursera course on Learning How To Learn a go. I’ve always felt like my learning could be better and more efficient and the course should only take a month to complete so why not? If it doesn’t help, well… I’ve wasted more time on far less helpful stuff in my life.

    Goals:
    * Start the Learning How To Learn course on Coursera

    Methodology:
    * Sign up for the course and watch about 40 minutes of material.

    Reflection:
    I know I know in my previous post in the Web Dev section I talked about how great the Pomodoro technique is and while it is great, I felt that 40 minutes of learning and 20 minutes to write this post is a great way to portion out the 1 hour total time I am trying to commit to my to-do list/improving my self daily.

    Now for the course, there isn’t much to say about it. I like the current workload and how the assignments are divided up. So what have I learned so far?

    I learned that there are two main modes of learning, Focused and Diffused. Focus mode is when we are actively concentrating on a problem and trying to learn something new. In contrast to diffused mode, which is when we are relaxed and not really thinking about it but the brain is still working on the problem. The key to solving new problems and learning new concepts is to utilize both modes as we can only be in one or the other. 

    They gave two examples of how Thomas Edison and Salvador Dali did this by focusing on a problem or concept for a bit, but then get really relaxed while holding something loud and heavy. They would vaguely allow their mind to work around the problem and when they dropped the heavy object they would come back to a more focused state with the ideas from the diffused state fresh in their mind. While I would love to try this, especially at work, I don’t think my coworkers would appreciate this, so I think I will need to figure out something better.

    They also covered in the course that learning takes time and can be aided by using analogies and metaphors to better visualize concepts. One good metaphor that they used is that the brain is like a muscle and the best way to keep information is to do reps everyday without overdoing it. I think this is key for me going forward because I used to be a crammer and honestly it has screwed me and I don’t really remember anything. So I am going to try to work almost everyday towards learning something new.

    Future Work:
    * Continue Learning How To Learn course on Coursera
