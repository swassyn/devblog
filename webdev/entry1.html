    Entry 1 - 06/08/2023

    Introduction:
    I decided this week that I would finally tackle some goals of mine that I have had for a while. This would be my first post on my Dev Blog. Yay. While my very minimal knowledge of HTML that I learned back in the early 2000s has allowed me to create links to different pages, there is still a lot to be learned to make this dev blog at the very least pleasing on the eyes. Ultimately the goal for this blog is to just have a place to dump my thoughts, experiences, and learnings that I have in my life. Hopefully, this will make me more accountable and actually achieve the goals I would like to accomplish before I die. Other possible positive outcomes :
    * Better habits
    * Better goal setting
    * Actually learning information
    * Actually applying learned information
    * Better communication
    * Better writing

    I am not really sure the best way to format or how often to make these posts so please bear with me as I will likely be inconsistent with formatting and frequency. The current outline is what I am thinking for each post regardless of page:
    * Introduction
    * Goals
    * Methodology
    * Reflection
    * Future Work

    With the introduction out of the way above let's move on to the rest of the material.

    Goals:
    While I don’t really have concrete or well planned goals (oops), I do know one thing and that is that I finally want to:
    * Start a Dev Blog

    Methodology:
    I needed something that I was at least semi familiar with because I didn’t want to spend hours on getting the initial formatting and pages setup. I also needed something that was free and wouldn’t be embarrassed to send a link to people if I wanted to share this blog. For these reasons github.io pages seemed to be a decent fit for this initial use case.
    * Follow what is on <a href="https://www.github.io/">https://www.github.io/</a> to set up a Dev Blog

    Reflection:
    The setup was relatively easy, and quick. I learned that I need to be more patient and actually read the instructions on the page instead of skimming because if I had done so, then the setup would have been flawless and completed even quicker. On the flipside, I probably should have done more research on better websites to host my dev blog on, but I feel like github is good enough for now. As someone who suffers from analysis paralysis and trying to perfect everything before taking the first step, there really is something to be said about just taking that leap of faith and starting something. After all, failure is going to be inevitable so why not fail early so that you can correct your mistakes and not waste even more of your precious time? You only really fail when you don't learn something and as Bob Ross claims, they are just “happy little mistakes”.

    Future Work:
    * Start <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> to spruce up this dev blog into something less... bland.
