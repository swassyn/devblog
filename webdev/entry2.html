    Entry 2 - Now we really begin- 06/11/2023
    Introduction:
    I am already seeing the mistakes of my initial design! The layout of my files and blog needed to be redone. For whatever reason I didn’t anticipate needing to have a more modular entry design. I thought I could just append entries to the top of page a la classic blog style, but then I sat down to write entry number two and this is when I realized I would get frustrated with such sloppy data management, so the structure had to be changed to every entry being its own page for the time being and linked under the web dev page. While I was at it I noticed that the first entry didn’t format at all how I was hoping, so I am going to add in what little HTML knowledge I can recall to make it readable for the average person (including me). Why didn’t I do this before? I could lie and say it’s because I forgot or was even too lazy, but the truth is I intentionally didn’t do it at first because of perfectionism and the want to learn stuff from the ground up properly instead of hog podging stuff together from Stack Overflow or ChatGPT. However, I can not function like this so I need to have at least the bare minimum formatting.

    With the Dev Blog updates out of the way let's get into what I have actually accomplished since the last post.

    Goal:
    * Start <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>

    Methodology:
    I wanted to get started but not overwhelm myself. I tried once before to do The Odin Project and I rushed through about 50% of the foundations, got frustrated and moved on to another project. Because I didn’t want to burn out (at least not so quickly this time) I decided that I would hold off on reading any of the supplemental material and instead will return to that at a later date. After all, I need to learn to trust the developers who have contributed to this project. I also need to actually take the time to ingest the information that they deem “core” so I need to not rush through this. So pretty much the ground rules became this:
    * Don’t worry about the supplemental info
    * Don’t rush through the content, take the time to absorb and understand the concepts being taught
    * If at any point your brain feels like mush, that’s all the learning for the day no matter how much drive you have to learn more. The brain is a muscle and needs rest.

    Reflection:
    Today was just a lot of reading. I didn’t get that far, in fact I didn’t even make it to the prerequisites portion of the course before my brain started to feel like mush, but like I learned from the readings this good and healthy and while I personally don’t like this feeling, it is an important thing to endure not just to learn better, but to change my mindset too. For too long I have been afraid of failure. For too long I have tried doing stuff all alone. For too long I have not actually learned stuff and fallen into a fixed mindset. I can learn more, but I need to accept these truths about the process:
    * It will be difficult and unpleasant at times, and this is okay. This is the only way I can grow both intellectually and as a person.
    * It’s okay to not have all the answers, in fact, it’s good to not have all the answers as that means there is still stuff to learn.
    * It can take a lot longer to learn material and that is okay too. I need to not judge my progress against anyone else's. Everyone learns at a different pace and the only thing that truly matters is if I actually learn something versus just “learning something”.
    * I am not the smartest person in the room and I never will be. I need to not put so much of my self worth into this single aspect of my life. People do not like a know it all, I don’t even like myself when I am a know it all. 
    * It’s okay to be average, it’s okay to fail, the important thing is to just get out there, fail, and try again.

    Below are something things that I found that spoke to me while I was reading the course content:

    “Try not to think of The Odin Project, or programming, as a class in school. It’s not material you learn all at once to take a test, and then pass or fail. You can think of it as a snowball. You, yourself, are a snowball. You’re rolling down a hill full of snow; the further you roll, the more snow will stick to you. Sure, snow will also fall off you, and you’ll forget things often, but that’s just part of the process. Don’t be scared if you get to a project and you feel like you haven’t retained or memorized anything. That’s natural and happens to everyone. The information will come back to you as you start solving your problems one at a time, …”[1]

    “Learning to code is incredibly rewarding but can also be difficult and frustrating. The strongest assets you can have as a student are a desire to build, a problem-solving mind, and persistence in the face of setbacks.”[2]

    These are some things I need to be reminded more of in my life. All learning should be thought of like this and I wish it was taught more in my schooling growing up. It is indeed okay to forget stuff as it is all part of the process. I also need to remember that like a snowball, I need to keep it moving to grow and gain more snow. Even if it is only a little bit of movement at a time no matter how frustrating it is.

    I also read the article <a href=”https://www.thinkful.com/blog/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard/”>Why Learning to Code is So Damn Hard</a>As someone who started coding before the “gamified” experience, I am glad I can finally experience the hand holding honeymoon phase with TOP, instead of just reading books and man pages. The whole article is great and explains what I have experienced in all my learning adventures, not just coding. The “desert of despair” section really resonated with me because I don’t think I have ever made it out of that desert, even to this day.

    “Take a moment to think about why you have decided to learn programming.”[3]

    I’ve had to think about this time and time again, and it always comes back to me wanting to do stuff with computers. I have always been fascinated with the machines and the programs that run and I really wanted to discover the how and the why of it. I also grew up on vidya games and as a result I always wanted to create one, and of course back then, you needed to know how to program to create one. These days it’s sadly mainly out of creativity, optimization, and the necessity to live.

    “There will be many times throughout The Odin Project that you will get stuck on a concept or a programming problem and may find yourself questioning your ability to learn programming. When you find yourself in this position, remind yourself that you may not get it yet but that with persistence and grit you will. Struggling with something is growth. It doesn’t matter how long you struggle with a concept or project; all that matters is that you have the grit and tenacity to see it through. That’s how real learning happens.”[4]

    “While you’re working through the curriculum, embrace the struggles you encounter with difficult concepts and complex projects. Be sure to celebrate your persistence in overcoming those struggles!”[4]

    Watched <a href=”https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve”>The power of believing that you can improve</a> and <a href=”https://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_grit_the_power_of_passion_and_perseverance/c>Grit: The power of passion and perseverance</a>

    “Researchers have known for some time that the brain is like a muscle; that the more you use it, the more it grows. They’ve found that neural connections form and deepen most when we make mistakes doing difficult tasks rather than repeatedly having success with easy ones. What this means is that our intelligence is not fixed, and the best way that we can grow our intelligence is to embrace tasks where we might struggle and fail.”[5]

    “However, not everyone realizes this. Dr. Carol Dweck of Stanford University has been studying people’s mindsets towards learning for decades. She has found that most people adhere to one of two mindsets: fixed or growth. Fixed mindsets mistakenly believe that people are either smart or not, that intelligence is fixed by genes. People with growth mindsets correctly believe that capability and intelligence can be grown through effort, struggle and failure. Dweck found that those with a fixed mindset tended to focus their effort on tasks where they had a high likelihood of success and avoided tasks where they may have had to struggle, which limited their learning. People with a growth mindset, however, embraced challenges, and understood that tenacity and effort could change their learning outcomes. As you can imagine, this correlated with the latter group more actively pushing themselves and growing intellectually.”[5]

    I love the idea of viewing things as yet or not yet because as someone who grew up scared to fail because failure was met with retribution and sadness this is inspiring to me. Earlier in my life I vaguely remember actually having a growth mindset, loving difficult problems, and seeking out knowledge more than I do these days and it was great. It brought me extreme joy, but I’ll be honest, I have fallen into a more fixed mindset and that really does need to change. Something deep inside me still yearns to learn and is okay with failure and I want to feed that passion. The one thing I am not prepared for is the pain that will come with the failure and the effort and energy required to change this mindset, but I also know that I can’t wait to be “prepared” and unfortunately this is just one of those things that I'll have to just wing it and start doing it. It will take a bunch of time and energy but the rewards will outweigh the costs.

    “When stuck on a concept or project, taking a break to refresh and let your subconscious work on making connections more often than not yields a solution to your problem. The trick is to put effort into solving the problem first and then take a break.”[6]

    “You will have more success with Odin by putting consistent time into it rather than working on it once a week. Building a habit of studying every day at a specific time and with a specific goal will ensure that you make consistent progress.”[7]

    “It may take you longer than others to grasp concepts, or it may take you less time. This doesn’t mean you’re smarter or dumber than others, it means you’ve had differing life experiences that may or may not have prepared you for learning this stuff. Someone who grew up around an engineer may have some advantages over someone who didn’t, but it doesn’t mean you can’t learn those skills.”[7]

    “You simply don’t know what you don’t know yet, and that’s OK! … Stress and anxiety absolutely do not help you learn either. Relax and just enjoy the ride.”[7]

    “Students often compare themselves to others who are farther along in their coding journey or have more experience. This is a recipe for depression and frustration.”[8]

    “Solution: Only compare yourself to your past self. Have your abilities and knowledge improved from where you were last week, last month, or last year? Be proud of the progress that you’ve made!” [8]

    These are more important points that I need to constantly be reminded of. I am someone who loves to go all out, “push through it”, and eventually burn out when trying to learn something or accomplish a goal. This always ends up with me becoming overly confident in my knowledge while also being completely wrong in what I had learned. I do need to take more breaks and learn when to take breaks. I also need to be consistent with my learning over a longer period of time to really help solidify the knowledge instead of just “cramming”. Finally, I need to just accept that some people will grasp certain concepts faster and slower than me and that is okay. I need to have compassion when talking with people who are struggling with content I know very well and remember back to when I struggled with it. I shouldn’t ever compare myself (in a degrading manner) to other people, but instead use them as inspiration and motivation for my future and what lies ahead.

    TOP then goes on to talk about the pomodoro technique to help keep you renewed and refreshed while learning, and I am so happy to see this mentioned. I am not sure when or why I was introduced into this before, but it is something I use everyday, whether it be to accomplish chores, work, or learning new concepts. I highly recommend people give it a try and feel free to make changes to the “rules” of the technique and varying times. Below are my modifications:
    * I only do 25 minutes of work with 5 minute breaks. I don’t take long breaks currently.
    * Interruptions are okay if they are less than 1 min long and you constantly try to go back to the work at hand. I found the interruption reset to be far too punishing for me, especially at work, so as long as the effort for 25 minutes was there, then I earned that 5 minute break.
    * Create a list of things to work on and if you complete one, start work on the next item. Even if 1 minute is left. In that 1 minute you can set up and prepare so that when you come back from your break you can just jump right in.

    My preferred pomodoro site to use is : <a href=”https://pomofocus.io/app”>https://pomofocus.io/app</a>

    “When things outside of your control happen you have to come up with a new plan that makes the most sense for that situation. You don’t have to blindly follow the rules. Come up with something that works for you. There’s no wrong answer here.“[9]

    This is something that I wish people like me would remember more. Don’t blindly follow the rules, it’s okay to experiment and change things up. There is no clear cut way to achieve something and things will come up outside your control and you will have to adjust to those roadblocks. That is okay and when they do, reassess the problem/goal at hand and create a new plan or implement modifications. The goal isn’t to do something the most efficiently in learning, the goal is to actually learn.

    There was also a small excerpt about AI tools and while I could use it, I won’t be using it until I grasp the foundations confidently. ChatGPT is amazing and while I do use it for some of my other projects, it doesn’t always get everything correct and therein lies the rub. Since I can’t know if what ChatGPT is spitting out is good or not, I really shouldn’t be using it… yet. Pandora’s box is open with AI and honestly, to me, it is just another tool in a workers toolbox to accomplish a task. It shouldn’t be used to replace the person even though it will definitely be tried to. 

    Sorry for such a long post, however, hopefully there is something I found insightful that you too also found insightful.

    Future Work:
    * Continue <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> Foundations Course [6% Complete]
    * Start Coursera’s <a href=”https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn”>Learning how to Learn</a> course per TOPs recommendation
